# COVID-19 tracker app
> an app that tracks covid-19 data 

## Personal notes 

- when we work with asynchronous data then it is wise to work with class based component.

## Usage 

- Shows the infected, recovered and death numbers of COVID-19. 
- Gives us interactive looks with chart. 
- We can select countries and see the statistics of that country.
